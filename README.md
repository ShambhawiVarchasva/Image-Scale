# Image-Scale
Python code for upscaling images using Bilinear Interpolation,Nearest Neighbor,Image Rotation

Q1. Rotate the image by thetha degree [Don’t use inbuilt functions].
Q2.Use bilinear interpolation to scale the image [Don’t use inbuilt
functions].
Q3. Given an image of size 512 × 512 and want to scale this to 870×870. Find out scaling
factor and and perform nearest neighbour operation[Don’t use
inbuilt functions].

Q4. Given a 3x3 image, we want to enlarge the image to a 5x5 image through bilinear
interpolation and nearest neighbor. Estimate the resulting 5x5 images after applying these
methods respectively.
